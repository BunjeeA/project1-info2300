# Project 1, Final Submission: Design Journey

[← Table of Contents](design-journey.md)

**Replace ALL _TODOs_ with your work.** (There should be no TODOs in the final submission.)

Be clear and concise in your writing. Bullets points are encouraged.

Place all design journey images inside the "design-plan" folder and then link them in Markdown so that they are visible in Markdown Preview.

**Everything, including images, must be visible in _Markdown: Open Preview_.** If it's not visible in the Markdown preview, then we can't grade it. We also can't give you partial credit either. **Please make sure your design journey should is easy to read for the grader;** in Markdown preview the question _and_ answer should have a blank line between them.


## Milestone 3 Feedback Revisions

## URL Design
> Plan your HTTP routing.
> List each route and the PHP file for each route.

| Route                 | PHP File                            |
| --------------------- | ----------------------------------- |
| /                     | pages/home.php (or pages/index.php) |
| /academics            | pages/academics.php                 |
| /work                 | pages/work.php                      |
| /contact              | pages/contact.php                   |
| /contact/confirmation | pages/contact-confirm.php           |

> Explain why these routes (URLs) are usable for your persona. (1 sentence)

I believe these routes are usable for Emily because the name/title of the page matches the url route that will be displayed in the browser.


## Missing Resource / Not Found Page
> Refine the design of your site's missing resource 404 page for your persona.
> Include iterations of **sketches** of the page.
> Provide a brief explanation _underneath_ each sketch. (1 sentence)
> **Refer to the persona by name.**

TODO: sketches + explanation


## Self-Reflection
> Take some time here to reflect on how much you've learned since you started this class. It's often easy to ignore our own progress. Take a moment and think about your accomplishments in this class. Hopefully you'll recognize that you've accomplished a lot and that you should be very proud of those accomplishments! (2-4 sentences)

- This was fun! Coming from 1300 with a pure frontend design-heavy focus to 2300 with a more backend approach was initially a challenge but I'm growing to enjoy it. I think that I will be more comfortable incorporating these concepts into my later projects.
